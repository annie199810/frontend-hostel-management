🔎 Role Behavior
Admin

Full access to all modules

Can create, edit, activate, and deactivate Staff users

Staff

Can manage rooms, residents, maintenance, billing, and reports

Cannot access User Management

ℹ️ Staff users are created only by Admin from the User Management page.

✨ Features (Frontend)
🔐 Authentication & Authorization

JWT-based login system

Token stored securely in localStorage

Protected routes (unauthorized users redirected to Login)

Role-based UI (Admin vs Staff)

🔁 Session Persistence

User session persists across browser refresh

On refresh, the frontend validates the token using the backend
/api/auth/me endpoint

If the token is valid, the user session is restored automatically

🏠 Room Management

Add / Edit / Delete rooms

Room status tracking:

Available

Occupied

Maintenance

Automatic occupancy updates based on resident allocation

Room status is controlled and synchronized with backend enums:
Available → Occupied → Available / Maintenance

Rooms cannot be assigned to multiple residents at the same time

Basic room availability and occupancy checks implemented
(Advanced concurrency handling can be added as a future enhancement)

👤 Resident Management 

Add / Edit / Delete residents

Assign residents to rooms

Track resident status (Active / Inactive)

Automatic room status update:

Room becomes Occupied when a resident is added

Room becomes Available when resident is removed or deactivated

Prevents incorrect room allocation

🔧 Maintenance Management (Frontend)

Raise maintenance requests for rooms

Track issue type (Electrical / Plumbing / Others)

Set priority (High / Medium / Low)

Update request status:

Open

In Progress

Closed

Helps staff track and resolve hostel issues efficiently

💳 Billing & Payments

Edit & delete bills

“Pay Now” option

Razorpay payment gateway integration (Test Mode)

Authorization: Bearer <token>


If token is missing or invalid → user is redirected to Login page

🧪 Scripts
npm run dev       # Start frontend locally
npm run build     # Build production files
npm run preview   # Preview production build

📌 Project Scope

This project focuses on clean UI, role-based access control, and core hostel management workflows.
Advanced features such as payment gateway live mode and concurrency locking are intentionally kept as future enhancements.
